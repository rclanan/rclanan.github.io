    Ray was an excellent mentor during my internship, showing me the ropes of technology and methodology I had never heard of before. His breadth of skill, depth of expertise, and excellent guidance directly influenced the project's success. I can honestly say that I am where I am today due to Ray. I look forward to the day when we can work together again, be it professionally or otherwise on any type of project.
