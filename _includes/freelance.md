### Contractual Basis

I am available for projects directly as a freelancer.

My normal billing is usually handled by the hour. Unless a sufficient detailed specification is provided, I'll reject fixed-price projects due to uncontrollable project risks for me and lack of sustainability on both sides.

As part of a consultant project with an hourly billing rate, I am happy to create a specification, if one is needed. 

### Fees

My fees vary according to the task, location and challenges to be solved. Feel free to [contact me](mailto: rclanan@utopianconcept.com) for further discussion. 

##### What I prefer:

  * Agile environment with good test coverage 
  * Direct collaboration with decision makers and product owners
  * Remote work 

##### Things that I surcharge for:

  * Legacy projects (depending on the technology, code quality and scope) 
  * No agile project management 
  * "Red Tape" 
  * Short-term "emergency" mission 

Using a third-party recruiter to hire me will cost you additional money (~15-30% depending on the recruiter). This is beyond my control, and the commission is varied based on the recruiter.
