After I setup my site and started blogging I landed a few client projects. The first of which went live today. It is a customized theme developed in [PrestaShop](http://www.prestashop.com/ "PrestaShop").

Before the initial launch I setup a custom landing page for newsletter signups and announcing the coming of the new site. Below is what the landing page looked like.

If you are interested in getting your own site up and running feel free to [contact me](http://utopianconcept.com/contact/ "Contact Me"). I am available for hire on a [freelancing](http://utopianconcept.com/freelance/ "Freelancing Information") basis. In the meantime feel free to browse the new site over at <a href="http://www.infinityhairsolutions.com" title="Infinity Hair Solutions" target="_blank">www.infinityhairsolutions.com</a>.
