In the words of Neil Armstrong, "That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind"[^1]. While today might not be a giant leap for mankind, today marks the day that I surpassed my previous commit streak on Github, so it's a big deal for me! Progress on a [personal commitment][2] that I made to myself sometime last week. Previously, my longest streak was 10 days, today is the 11th day. I know, not a major accomplishment but have to start small, take baby steps, and celebrate the victories where and when we can!

According to the book [Psycho-Cybernetics][3], [Dr. Maxwell Maltz][4], it takes a minimum of about 21 days to form a new habit. A further [study][5] done at the University College London and published in the _European Journal of Social Psychology_, states that on average, it takes 66 days to before a new behavior becomes automatic. Regardless what the magic number is to form this new habit I have committed to, you have to start with day 1 and approach each day as a new battle. View every yesterday as a small victory in its own right.

On that note though, I also feel that it's also good to set reasonable achievable short term goals for yourself, longer than a single day. To give yourself something to push for and give those daily 'battles' meaning. My first goal was to get past my longest commit of 10 days. Since I have achieved that, and want to make this a habit, I will shoot for hitting the "21 days" as my next goal since its closer than 66. Ten days doesn't seem like very far away, but when you are taking baby steps, it might seem like forever!

To those that took the time to read this post, thanks for celebrating my small victory with me!

As always, until next time...
