In this new series, I plan on creating a guide that will demonstrate how to create the same basic REST API in different programming languages.

As some of you who know me may know, I am very passionate about programming. I love learning a new language and comparing it to languages that I have already picked up. I am not entirely sure why I like so many different languages and can't seriously answer which is my favorite language suffice to say I am enamored with all aspects of programming in general.

Now with that being said, one of the best ways that I learn to pick up a new language, is to dive in and create something that I created before in a different language, sort of like the premise of creating the hello world application that most books start with, however I feel that approach is too simplistic of an example so I decided to create this series on creating a basic REST API. This will be more so for my own personal reference as are all the blog post that I write but maybe this can also become somewhat of a [ Rosetta Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) for someone else trying to pick up a new language as well.

The first guide that I will create will deal with languages that I already have experience with just to get me into the flow of creating the guides. The follow-up guides will be for languages that are new to me. If there are any requests for a particular guide then I will be happy to do those as well. Also, I welcome any comments in which the guides can be improved.

With all of that out of the way, letâ€™s say we get on with the guide. In this introduction, I am just going to cover the basics questions.

1. What is an API?
2. Examples of an Web API
3. HTTP Methods and HTTP Status Codes
4. What is REST?
5. Examples of REST

    - REST API in python using flask

### What is an API? ###

An API or **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface can be defined as a contract (or [interface]( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interface)) in which other applications utilize to interact with your system. In doing so this provides externally exposed features into your rather closed environment.

For this simplistic categorization of APIs, we can think of APIs coming in two flavors, one being software APIs and the other being web APIs. The focus of this series will be REST APIs which is a type of Web APIs.

Software APIs typically are related to software libraries or frameworks and are generally geared more towards desktop or client/server type applications.

Web APIs on the other hand deal with HTTP (**H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) methods and HTTP Status Codes. More on those later, but the methods are the actions which typically control the API and the status codes along with a  response message is the result of what the API passes back.

### Examples of a Web API ###

Many of the most popular websites have published public APIs these days. Some examples of those are:

1. [Github API](http://developer.github.com/v3/)
2. [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/apis/)
3. [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/)
