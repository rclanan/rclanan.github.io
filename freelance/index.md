### Contractual Basis

I am available for projects directly as a freelancer.

My normal billing is usually handled by the hour. Unless a sufficient detailed specification is provided, I'll reject fixed-price projects due to uncontrollable project risks for me and lack of sustainability on both sides.

As part of a consultant project with an hourly billing rate, I am happy to create a specification, if one is needed.

### Fees

My fees vary according to the task, location and challenges to be solved. Feel free to [contact me](mailto: rclanan@utopianconcept.com) for further discussion.

##### What I prefer:

* Agile environment with good test coverage
* Direct collaboration with decision makers and product owners
* Remote work

##### Things that I surcharge for:

* Legacy projects (depending on the technology, code quality and scope)
* No agile project management
* "Red Tape"
* Short-term "emergency" mission

Using a third-party recruiter to hire me will cost you additional money (~15-30% depending on the recruiter). This is beyond my control, and the commission is varied based on the recruiter.

Want to hire me? Send me an
[email](mailto: rclanan@utopianconcept.com).

Ray was an excellent mentor during my internship, showing me the ropes of technology and methodology I had never heard of before. His breadth of skill, depth of expertise, and excellent guidance directly influenced the project's success. I can honestly say that I am where I am today due to Ray. I look forward to the day when we can work together again, be it professionally or otherwise on any type of project.
